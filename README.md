# Master's Thesis: Development of a Seizure Detection Method Using EEG Signals  

## Overview  
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and results of my master's thesis: **"Development of a Seizure Detection Method Using EEG Signals"**. The research focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques for the detection of epileptic seizures based on the CHB-MIT EEG dataset.

## Features  
- Preprocessing of EEG signals, including filtering and feature extraction.  
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection.  
- Evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.  
- Visualization of EEG signals and model performance.

## Dataset  
The CHB-MIT EEG dataset was used for this project. For more details, visit the [CHB-MIT EEG Dataset website](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/).
