# EEG_Detection
This repository contains the code, documentation, and results of my master's thesis: "Development of a Seizure Detection Method Using EEG Signals". The project involves the implementation and evaluation of machine learning algorithms applied to the CHB-MIT EEG dataset for detecting epileptic seizures.
